Process
Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualizations using Python
Cleaning data (dealing with NaN values, empty values, duplicate rows, standardizing heading names, checking outliers, etc.)
Querying in SQL
Pre-processing data for modeling (X/y split, train/test split, encoding categoricals and scaling numericals)
Defining and running the model (Logistic Regression) and choosing which metric is most important (precision, recall, or f1)
Treating data imbalance (upsampling, downsampling, SMOTE) to improve model scores
Re-running model with each data balance technique and comparing their confusion matrix and metrics
Drawing conclusions about data from the model
Hypothesis testing : Is the (average) average account balance of all Hawkins Bank customers the same as the (average) average account balance of customers who didn't take the credit card offer?
Data visualizations in Tableau comparing demographics of customers who did and didn't take the offer
Preparation of presentation to explain findings and actions to be taken by the bank to increase the percentage of customers who will take a credit card offer sent in the mail.
7-minute live presentation to 12 colleagues to present project and data-driven insights followed by 10-minute discussion
