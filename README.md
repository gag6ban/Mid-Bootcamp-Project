# Consumer Preference in German Car Market 

## By: Will & Gaurav | 9 October 2022

## Background
I'm a risk analyst for Hawkins Bank in Hawkins, Indiana. In order to better understand the demographics of its clients that accept a credit card offer, Hawkins Bank has designed a focused marketing study, where they sent 18,000 current bank clients a credit card offer in the mail. This focused approach allows the bank to know who does and does not respond to the offer, and to analyze this data with existing demographic data of each customer.

Objective: Build a classification model to predict which bank customers will sign up for a credit card offer sent by mail. Use this model to suggest actionable insights to Hawkins Bank to improve the sign-up rate of their next credit card mailer campaign.
Data: The data set consists of 14 demographic features on 18,000 current bank customers:
Customer Number: A sequential number assigned to the customers.
Offer Accepted: Did the customer accept (Yes) or reject (No) the offer.
Reward: The type of reward program offered for the card.
Mailer Type: Letter or postcard.
Income Level: Low, Medium or High.
Number of Bank Accounts: How many non-credit-card accounts are held by the customer.
Overdraft Protection: Does the customer have overdraft protection on their checking account(s) (Yes or No).
Credit Rating: Low, Medium or High.
Number of Credit Cards Held: The number of credit cards held at the bank.
Number of Homes Owned: The number of homes owned by the customer.
Household Size: Number of individuals in the family.
Own Your Home: Does the customer own their home? (Yes or No).
Average Balance: Average account balance (across all accounts over time). Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4
Balance: Average balance for each quarter in the last year
Process
Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualizations using Python
Cleaning data (dealing with NaN values, empty values, duplicate rows, standardizing heading names, checking outliers, etc.)
Querying in SQL
Pre-processing data for modeling (X/y split, train/test split, encoding categoricals and scaling numericals)
Defining and running the model (Logistic Regression) and choosing which metric is most important (precision, recall, or f1)
Treating data imbalance (upsampling, downsampling, SMOTE) to improve model scores
Re-running model with each data balance technique and comparing their confusion matrix and metrics
Drawing conclusions about data from the model
Hypothesis testing : Is the (average) average account balance of all Hawkins Bank customers the same as the (average) average account balance of customers who didn't take the credit card offer?
Data visualizations in Tableau comparing demographics of customers who did and didn't take the offer
Preparation of presentation to explain findings and actions to be taken by the bank to increase the percentage of customers who will take a credit card offer sent in the mail.
7-minute live presentation to 12 colleagues to present project and data-driven insights followed by 10-minute discussion
